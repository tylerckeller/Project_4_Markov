Challenges: I ran into a couple segmentation faults and arithmetic exceptions
during the implementation of this program. Most of them came from picking
random seeds and random elements from my maps. Figuring out the cause of these
was somewhat easy, however.

Like/Dislike: I enjoyed this project as it had an interesting output. Developing
random text from an input file was satisfying, interesting, and new

Time: 2 hours
